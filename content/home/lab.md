Our lab works on the intersection of computer engineering, statistical analysis and biology science.
Based out of the [OHSU Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/cancer/research-training/index.cfm)
we study systems biology, cancer, computational systems and integrative analysis. We work on projects funded by the
Nation Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).

If you are interested, we are looking for:

 - PhD Students
 - Post Docs
 - Engineering Staff
 - Scientific Research Staff
