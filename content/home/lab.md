Our lab works on the intersection of computer engineering, statistical analysis and biology science.
Based out of the [OHSU Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/cancer/research-training/index.cfm)
we study systems biology, cancer, computational systems and integrative analysis. We work on projects funded by the
Nation Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).
