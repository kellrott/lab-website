abstract: Summary Molecular subtypes, such as defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
  delineate a cancer’s underlying biology, bringing hope to inform a patient’s prognosis
  and treatment plan. However, most approaches used in the discovery of subtypes are
  not suitable for assigning subtype labels to new cancer specimens from other studies
  or clinical trials. Here, we address this barrier by applying five different machine
  learning approaches to multi-omic data from 8,791 TCGA tumor samples comprising
  106 subtypes from 26 different cancer cohorts to build models based upon small numbers
  of features that can classify new samples into previously defined TCGA molecular
  subtypes—a step toward molecular subtype application in the clinic. We validate
  select classifiers using external datasets. Predictive performance and classifier-selected
  features yield insight into the different machine-learning approaches and genomic
  data platforms. For each cancer and data type we provide containerized versions
  of the top-performing models as a public resource.
