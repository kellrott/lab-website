The ICGC-TCGA DREAM Genomic Mutation Calling Challenge (herein, The Challenge)
is an international effort to improve standard methods for identifying
cancer-associated mutations and rearrangements in whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
data. Leaders of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer genomics projects are joining with Sage
Bionetworks and IBM-DREAM to initiate this innovative open crowd-sourced Challenge.
