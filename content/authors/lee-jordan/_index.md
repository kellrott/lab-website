Jordan A. Lee is a computational biologist in Dr. Kyle Ellrott's lab at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute. She is currently taking a multi-platform machine learning approach to predict tumor phenotypes through cross model performance and optimization analysis. Additionally, she is interrogating BMEG data integration builds and drug response consistency across established genomic sources and published literature to identify actionable gaps in cancer research. She is also investigating common single-cell protocols for confounding variables in order to suggest single-cell guidlines for researchers. Lastly, she is benchmarking RNA deconvolution algorithms of cancer patient samples and tumors generated through 3D bioprinting tumor cells.
