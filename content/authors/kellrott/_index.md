My primary research goal is the application of large scale computing techniques and data integration for the analysis of genomics and systems biology. My current focus has been on biological systems analysis of cancer biology where I specialize in large scale computing problems that require heterogeneous analysis and data. For the past several years I have been extensively involved in the TCGA project, coordinating large scale variant calling efforts and enabling integrative analysis. I worked as the data coordinator for the TCGA PanCancer project, which was the joint effort of more than 100 scientists and my critical role allowed the publication of seventeen manuscripts.I have worked on several large compute platform projects, including working as the OHSU technical lead on the OHSU/Intel Collaborative Cancer Cloud and for the BioMedical Evidence Graph(BMEG). These projects have sought to enable researchers to utilize powerful computational systems to do large scale integrative analysis. I plan to use this experience to enable the next generation of integrative analysis. Despite an extensive history in computer engineering and the technological development of platforms for analysis, my work is guided by enabling actual analytical problems, with a principle goal of working with biological collaborators with to drive relevant research.
